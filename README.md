This repository provides the codes for the paper "Inference on Multi-level Brain Connectivities based on fMRI Data" by Yumou Qiu and Xiao-Hua Zhou.

**PC-individual.txt** includes the function *individual(X, ...)* to estimate the locations of nonzero off-diagonal elements in a p by p partial correlation matrix, based on p-dimensional time series data *X* of size n. This function can be used to estimate the nonzero partial correlations among brain regions of an individual using the fMRI data.
