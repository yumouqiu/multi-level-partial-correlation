This repository provides the codes for the paper "Inference on Multi-level Brain Connectivities based on fMRI Data" by Yumou Qiu and Xiao-Hua Zhou.

**PC-individual.txt** includes the function *individual(X, ...)* to estimate the locations of nonzero off-diagonal elements in a p by p partial correlation matrix, based on p-dimensional time series data *X* of size n. This function can be used to estimate the nonzero partial correlations among brain regions of an individual using the fMRI data.  
The output *cbind(recovery, Liu)* is two p by p binary (0-1) matrices combining together by columns, where *recovery* is the output of the proposed method with 1 and 0 indicating significant nonzero and zero partial correlations respectively, and *Liu* is the output of the method for time independent data from the paper "Gaussian graphical model estimation with false discovery rate control" by Liu, W., The Annals of Statistics, 41, 2948â€“2978, 2013.

**PC-population-1Sample.txt** includes the function *population(Z, ...)* to estimate
